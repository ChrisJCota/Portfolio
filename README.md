##Descripion

This project was created in order to have a space to store my projects so they are easily accessible to me. This was also created so that
companies can easily review my profile without having to look up my GitHub account.


##Usage

This will be used in order to display my personal profile & projects for companies to review and for storage of projects that I have created.
